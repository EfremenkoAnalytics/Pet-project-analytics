I made my 1-st pet project with python. For this project I used dataset that contains a list of video games dating from 1980 to 2023, 
it also provides things such as release dates, user review rating, and critic review rating.
Here is the visualisation result: https://public.tableau.com/shared/PT3D9BQDW?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
